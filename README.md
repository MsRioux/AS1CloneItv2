In the repo, click the green “Clone or download” button.  Click the Copy button next to the URL.

In IntelliJ, Create a new project File-> New -> Project from Version Control -> Git.  Paste the URL in the field (look where the file is going to be put, in case you need to find it later).  Click Clone.

This file will then exist locally (that is, only on the device you are currently working on).  It will not have any connection to the original file.
